Since then, it has steadily developed and grown from a local provider in executive education to an international university. GISMA University of Applied Sciences is headquartered in Potsdam, with an additional location in Berlin. Language courses, cooperative degree programmes and leadership training are offered in Berlin, Hamburg, Hannover, and London.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">Since 2013, it has been part of Global University Systems (GUS). GUS is an international network of universities and other institutions in the education sector that have come together out of a shared passion for accessible, practical educational qualifications.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">GUS offers a wide range of programmes, including bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degree programmes, vocational qualifications, language training, as well as corporate and executive education. When someone chooses to study at one of the GUS institutions - whether on campus in Europe, North America or from their home - they join a network of 75,000 students worldwide.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">Beyond Germany, GUS has campuses for example in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, and Israel.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">Additionally, through a range of partnerships with schools including the triple-accredited Grenoble Ecole de Management, The University of Law and Kingston University, GISMA has expanded its selection of programmes providing more students with the opportunity to pursue their career ambitions.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">In 2018, GISMA announced the establishment of its first centre outside of Germany, in London, dedicated to delivering executive education. This was a significant step for GISMA in terms of achieving an international presence.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"GreenLine BackgroundGrey\">In 2020, GISMA Business School has been state recognised as University of Applied Sciences by the German federal state of Brandenburg and granted degree awarding powers. This is being accompanied by the expansion into its brand-new flagship campus in Potsdam and of its portfolio to include programmes in areas such as Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, with degrees awarded directly by GISMA Business School.</span></p>\\n</div>\\n</div> </div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\'container mb-5\\'>\\n<div class=\"row clearfix\">\\n<div class=\"col-md-6 xs-mt4 column\">\\n<div class=GreenLine>\\n<p><span class=SubTitle>We strongly believe in the positive power of change as a motor for continuous improvement and innovation.</span></p>\\n</div>\\n</div> <div class=\"col-md-6 xs-mt4 column\">\\n<div>\\n<div class=yt-container>\\n<div class=\"yt-video image-overlay\" data-embed=GMxTw1-h3T8>\\n<div class=yt-play-button>\\n<i class=\"fa fa-youtube-play fa-3x\" title=\"Watch video\"></i>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=yt-overlay></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div> </div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\'container mb-5\\'>\\n<div class=\"row clearfix\">\\n<div class=\"col-md-12 xs-mt4 column\">\\n<div>\\n<p><span class=GreenText>Leaders for the Future</span></p>\\n<p>Our faculty and staff are passionate about creating the leaders of tomorrow.</p>\\n<p>Students are supported in their search for internships and jobs in Germany.

            "GISMA has been established in 1999. Since then, it has steadily developed and grown from a local provider in executive education to an international university. GISMA University of Applied Sciences is headquartered in Potsdam, with an additional location in Berlin. Language courses, cooperative degree programmes and leadership training are offered in Berlin, Hamburg, Hannover, and London.\n",
            "Since 2013, it has been part of Global University Systems (GUS). GUS is an international network of universities and other institutions in the education sector that have come together out of a shared passion for accessible, practical educational qualifications.\n",
            "GUS offers a wide range of programmes, including bachelor's and master's degree programmes, vocational qualifications, language training, as well as corporate and executive education. When someone chooses to study at one of the GUS institutions - whether on campus in Europe, North America or from their home - they join a network of 75,000 students worldwide.\n",
            "Beyond Germany, GUS has campuses for example in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, and Israel.\n",
            "Additionally, through a range of partnerships with schools including the triple-accredited Grenoble Ecole de Management, The University of Law and Kingston University, GISMA has expanded its selection of programmes providing more students with the opportunity to pursue their career ambitions.\n",
            "In 2018, GISMA announced the establishment of its first centre outside of Germany, in London, dedicated to delivering executive education. This was a significant step for GISMA in terms of achieving an international presence.\n",
            "In 2020, GISMA Business School has been state recognised as University of Applied Sciences by the German federal state of Brandenburg and granted degree awarding powers. This is being accompanied by the expansion into its brand-new flagship campus in Potsdam and of its portfolio to include programmes in areas such as Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, with degrees awarded directly by GISMA Business School.\n",
